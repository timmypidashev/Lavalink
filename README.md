# Lavalink
Simple _set and forget_ lavalink node configuration.

Just clone the repositroy with:
```bash
git lfs clone https://github.com/timmypidashev/Lavalink
```
cd into the directory and run(preferrably in a tmux session, although its not required):
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

That's it! To change the node configuration, simply edit the `application.yml` file.
